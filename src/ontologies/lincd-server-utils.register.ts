/**
 * Registers this ontology.
 *
 * Kept out of `lincd-server-utils.ts` because registration needs that module's whole export
 * namespace, and a module cannot import itself once a bundler is involved: Rollup
 * treats a static self-reference as a circular import and elides it, so the binding is
 * undefined at runtime and the consuming app dies at boot with `_this is not
 * defined`. `tsc` preserves it, which is why the pattern survived for as long as
 * packages were built with `tsc` alone.
 *
 * From a sibling module the same import is ordinary and survives.
